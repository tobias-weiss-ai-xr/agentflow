# lifecycle Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change rust-orchestrator. Update Purpose after archive.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Execute pipeline

For each task attempt, `af` SHALL: create a git worktree on a fresh branch; render a prompt from the task template; spawn the agent CLI with `--provider <p> --model <m> -p @<prompt-file>`; if the agent succeeds, run the acceptance gate; if the gate passes, merge the branch to the base branch; otherwise record failure/retry.

#### Scenario: happy path

WHEN the agent exits 0 and the acceptance gate exits 0
THEN the task branch is merged to the base branch and the task reaches `done`.

#### Scenario: gate failure

WHEN the agent exits 0 but the gate exits non-zero
THEN the task is marked `failed` (or retried), never merged.

#### Scenario: agent failure

WHEN the agent CLI exits non-zero
THEN the attempt fails without running the gate and without merging.

### Requirement: Subprocess execution contract

All subprocesses (agent, gate, git) SHALL run through one helper that captures stdout/stderr, applies a hard timeout, kills the process tree on timeout or abort, and classifies the result by exit code (success / non-zero / killed-by-us / missing-binary). No subprocess SHALL outlive the orchestrator.

#### Scenario: timeout kills

WHEN a gate exceeds its timeout
THEN the process is killed, the attempt fails, and no merge happens.

### Requirement: Prompt rendering

A task prompt SHALL be rendered from `prompts/worker.md` with the task's `title`, `id`, `scope`, and `acceptance_prose` substituted, and written to a file passed to the agent CLI. For attempt ≥ 2, the rendered prompt SHALL also include a "Previous attempts" block listing this task's earlier failed attempts (attempt number + error line) so the agent avoids repeating them. Attempt 1 SHALL render without the block.

#### Scenario: template substitution

WHEN a task with title and acceptance prose is dispatched
THEN the rendered prompt file contains the task title and acceptance prose.

#### Scenario: retry prompt names the earlier failure

GIVEN attempt 1 of task A failed with an agent exit code
WHEN attempt 2 renders its prompt
THEN the prompt contains a previous-attempts entry for attempt 1.

#### Scenario: first attempt has no history block

GIVEN a task dispatching its first attempt
WHEN the prompt renders
THEN no previous-attempts block appears.

### Requirement: Gate replay contract

Every task SHALL carry a `gate_replay` flag that defaults to `true`, and `af`
SHALL export the effective decision to the acceptance gate as the environment
variable `TF_GATE_REPLAY` (`1` when replay is on, `0` when a task opts out).
This lets a user-authored acceptance gate detect a resumed or replayed run and
stay idempotent.

#### Scenario: gate_replay defaults to true

WHEN a task omits `gate_replay`
THEN the loaded task has `gate_replay == true`.

#### Scenario: explicit opt-out parses

WHEN a task declares `"gate_replay": false`
THEN the loaded task has `gate_replay == false`.

#### Scenario: replay decision reaches the gate

WHEN the acceptance gate runs
THEN `TF_GATE_REPLAY` is exported to the gate process as `1` when replay is on and `0` when it is off.

### Requirement: Prompt placeholder guarantee

Every agent-prompt render path SHALL emit the task's file scope and the exact
acceptance gate command, and SHALL leak no unresolved `{{...}}` placeholder or
conditional marker. A configured template that omits `{{SCOPE}}`,
`{{ACCEPTANCE}}` or `{{ACCEPT_CMD}}` SHALL be reported on stderr and repaired
by appending the missing sections; a template that cannot be read SHALL fall
back to the built-in default. An empty scope SHALL render as the `*` wildcard.

#### Scenario: every render path carries scope and gate command

WHEN a prompt renders from the built-in default, a complete custom template, or a hostile template that omits the placeholders
THEN the output contains every scope path, the task id and title, and the exact `accept` command verbatim.

#### Scenario: no placeholder leaks

WHEN any render path produces a prompt
THEN the output contains no `{{` token, because substituted placeholders and conditional markers are both removed.

#### Scenario: hostile template is repaired

WHEN a custom template omits `{{SCOPE}}`, `{{ACCEPTANCE}}` and `{{ACCEPT_CMD}}`
THEN `af` warns on stderr and appends auto-filled scope, acceptance and gate-command sections.

#### Scenario: empty scope renders the wildcard

WHEN a task declares no scope entries
THEN the rendered prompt shows `*` for the file scope.
